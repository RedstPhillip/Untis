# School Management System ðŸ“š

## Project Overview

This project is a School Management System called Untis and it is designed to manage various aspects of a school, including students, teachers, classes, and grades. The system is built using Python and SQLite for database management. It includes functionalities for administrators, teachers, students, and parents to interact with the system.

## Current Status ðŸš§

**Note:** This project is currently on pause and is not finished. The prediction functionality is not yet completely implemented, and the existing code may not be of high quality as it was written some time ago. The code is outdated, and would be written differently now. The structure is complete, but the project is on hold.

## Features âœ¨

### Administrator
- **Create and delete teachers and students**: Administrators can add new teachers and students to the system and remove them when necessary.
- **View classes and teachers**: Administrators can view the list of classes and teachers.
- **Manage school year**: Administrators can start a new school year, which involves promoting students and resetting class enrollments.

### Teacher
- **Create tests and announcements**: Teachers can create tests for their classes and make announcements.
- **View profiles and class stats**: Teachers can view their profiles and statistics for their classes.

### Student
- **Rate teachers and set goals**: Students can rate their teachers and set personal academic goals.
- **Receive messages**: Students can receive messages from class and school chats.

### Parent
- **View child profile and excuse absences**: Parents can view their child's profile and excuse their absences.
